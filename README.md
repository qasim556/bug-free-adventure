# bug-free-adventure
i can assure you there are plenty of bugs 🐞

this was a small unfinished project that has a story and is like a tell-tale style game where decisions you make impact your adventure
this gives your character a personality that you own.
it also has an exp and battle system to make you feel you are progressing through the game along with the story.
the code file also includes a plan of changes at the bottom that could be added.
